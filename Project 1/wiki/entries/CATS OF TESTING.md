# Just used this to test my wiki dupe
## Yeah this is a second level heading
I think I got it **yay!**
I'm just going to link to my [cats](/wiki/cats) page.
Finally, here is a little list of animals:
* cats
* dog
* snake
* fish
In order of how much I favor them it would be:
1. dog
1. cat
1. snake
1. fish (they are too boring)
So that's the end of the tester page.
